# Snake Game in Python

## Overview
This is a simple **Snake Game** implemented in **Python** using the **Pygame** library. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows longer each time it eats food, and the objective is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Features
- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using arrow keys.
- **Food Mechanics**: The snake grows in length each time it eats food.
- **Collision Detection**: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- **Game Window**: The game runs in a 600x400 pixel window with a simple interface.

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake (Up, Down, Left, Right).

## Game Rules
- The snake **grows** by one segment every time it eats food.
- The game ends when the snake **collides with itself** or the **walls**.
- You can restart the game by closing the window and re-running the script.

## Extra Features Being Worked On
I am currently working on adding the following extra features to enhance the gameplay experience:

### 1. **Score System**:
   - Display the player's current score based on the number of food pieces eaten.
   - Track high scores and save them for future sessions.

### 2. **Speed Levels**:
   - The snake's speed will increase over time or as the player reaches certain score thresholds.
   - This will add more challenge to the game as it progresses.

### 3. **Game Menu**:
   - A main menu screen will allow the player to start a new game, view high scores, and exit.
   - Add an option for **difficulty levels** (Easy, Medium, Hard).

### 4. **Restart Feature**:
   - After the game ends, the player will be able to restart the game without closing the window.

### 5. **Obstacle Implementation**:
   - Introduce static obstacles on the screen that the snake must avoid while navigating.
   - This will increase the difficulty and make the game more engaging.

### 6. **Sound Effects**:
   - Add sound effects for **eating food**, **game over**, and **moving** to create a more immersive experience.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow two players to play on the same screen and control their respective snakes.
- **Advanced AI**: Implement an AI that can play the game autonomously and compete with the player.
